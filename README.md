The aim of using this dataset is to manipulate and prepare it for forecasting values


Some of the key features used in this work are: 
• Formed a new data frame from the given data
• Performed min-max normalization
• Built a knn function that implements a regression version of kNN that averages the prices of the k nearest neighbors using a weighted average where the weight is 3 for the closest neighbor, 2 for the second closest and 1 for the remaining neighbors.
• Adopted the use of set.seed command to randomly distribute the values and used training data set of 85% value.
• Calculated the weighted average
• Used line graph and scattered plot to visualize the data
• Finally, I created a new data set in which I evaluated different values of the columns by using different data frames and finally merged all of them to create a new data set
• Obtained the forecasted value
